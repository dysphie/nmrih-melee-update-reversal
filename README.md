# [NMRiH] 1.13.3 Melee Update Reversal

The 1.13.3 update introduced "Fixed melee traces ignoring objects and walls" which is causing legit hits not to register when zombies are clustered together. This plugin simply reverts the change until an official hotfix is released. 
It's not the most elegant solution, and I might code something better if the update faces further delays
