# [NMRiH] 1.13.3 Melee Update Reversal

The 1.13.3 update made a change that affected how melee attacks work. It was meant to stop melee attacks from going through objects and walls, but it's causing a problem where hits don't count when zombies are close together. This plugin, for now, undoes that change until the game gets a proper fix. It's not a perfect solution because it lets you hit zombies through walls again, and I might make a better one if the official hotfix doesn't release soon.
